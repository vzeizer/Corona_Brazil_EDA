## Project's Title: Coronavirus in Brazil: EDA

The goal of this mini-project is to investigate the causes of deaths in Brazil in 2019 and 2020.
The analysis of the total of deaths in these years will be done regarding the gender, age, state, color, cause of death (including coronavirus).
We aim at understanding who are the main groups affected during the pandemics, by studying the information given in this simplified dataset.
